            <h2>What is Sports?</h2>
            <p>
                Sports are a great way to stay active and maintain physical fitness. They offer mental and emotional benefits 
                that many other hobbies cannot provide. Sports bring people together, whether through teamwork or competition. 
                At the end of the day, both the winning and losing teams share a mutual respect for each other.

                    I started in 2020 during quarantine and played as a starter for two years. 
                    Football taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, leadership, and resilience.

                    Fall is the typical season for football. 
                    The game requires coordination and teamwork between players and coaches. 
                    Coaches strategize by making play calls based on the opposing team's defense or offense. 
                    Football is a highly physical sport that can also be quite dangerous.

                    which helps with stopping and controlling speed.

                Start by choosing a sport, learning its rules, and practicing regularly. 
                Some sports are easier to learn than others. 
                A great way to begin is with running, as it builds staminaâ€”an essential skill for almost every sport. 
                However, if running isn't your thing, 
                diving straight into a sport you love is perfectly fine. 
                The most important thing is to have fun!
