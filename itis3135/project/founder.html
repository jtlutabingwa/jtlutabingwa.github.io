          <p>
            Holly founded <strong>The Conscious Closet</strong> out of a passion for sustainability and fashion. 
            Witnessing firsthand the environmental toll of fast fashion, 
            she set out to create a space where people could learn, engage, and take action. Holly is currently studying
            Fashion at the Univeristy of North Carolina at Greensboro.  She has also decided to Minor in Business
            to get a better understand of the different business aspects that influence the fashion industry. 
            Through education, community events, and curated resources, Holly aims to empower individuals 
            to make more mindful wardrobe choices.

            "I believe change starts with awareness—and even small steps like reusing or rethinking 
            what we wear can lead to a massive shift. The Conscious Closet is more than a site—it's a 
            movement for mindful living."
