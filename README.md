<h1>Welcome to my ITIS 3135 Course Webpage Description</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
This repository showcases my coursework for ITIS 3135: Web-Based Application Design and Development, where I built a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Alongside completing multiple weekly assignments, I also earned two FreeCodeCamp certifications to reinforce my skills.
<br>
<br>
The course culminated in a final client project, where I collaborated with a fashion student from UNCG to design and develop a website focused on sustainable fashion. 
This project emphasized both technical implementation and real-world client collaboration, including gathering requirements and incorporating user-driven ideas into the design.
<br>
<br>
Throughout the class, I enhanced my abilities in time management, critical thinking, and web development, while gaining practical experience in delivering professional, client-oriented solutions.
